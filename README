Ion Auth

Simple and Lightweight Auth System 
based on Redux Auth 2  
(but much better of course)

======================================

Hey everybody,

Redux Auth 2 had a lot of potential.  It's lightweight, simple, and clean, 
but had a ton of bugs and was missing some key features.

So I've refactored the code and added new methods and functions with the much 
appreciated help of Phil Sturgeon.
